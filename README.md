## App Description
We built an AI Trivia app that generates randomized multiple-choice trivia questions using OpenAI's GPT 3.5 Model and prompts the user to answer these questions. If the user answers correctly, then they can advance to the next question and their score will be accordingly incremented, however, if the user gets a question wrong, their score resets and they must re-attempt the quiz. The best score of the user during their session is also recorded. The goal of the application is to expose the user to a diversity of trivia topics, as the OpenAI model has been trained on a wide plethora of resources.
